prometheus-es-exporter (0.11.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * initial debianization
  * patch: remove jog dependency: jog is not available in Debian,
    and appears to simply be a wrapper around the logger to generate
    json structured log output.  standard logger is fine.
  * patch: include click-config-file dependency: click-config-file
    is not available in Debian, but is central to the configuration
    functionality in this project.  since the library is a single
    file, it is trivial to simply include it.
